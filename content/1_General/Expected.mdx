## Getting Started

It's probably best to start with shorter problems than those you typically find in USACO Bronze. The following resources may be helpful for familiarizing yourself with your language of choice.

<!-- Resources below (including starred ones) are optional. -->

<Resources>
	<Resource
		source="CodeSignal"
		title="Arcade, Interview Practice"
		url="https://codesignal.com/"
	>
		no need to handle input or output
	</Resource>
	<Resource
		source="VPlanet"
		title="Learn to Code"
		url="https://www.vplanetcoding.com/course1"
	>
		basic problemsets with and without nested loops
	</Resource>
	<Resource
		source="CSES"
		title="Introductory Problems"
		url="https://cses.fi/problemset/list/"
	>
		up to and including "Palindrome Reorder"
	</Resource>
</Resources>

## Introductory USACO Bronze Problems

<!-- The following problems require relatively little programming experience and no algorithmic knowledge. -->

<Problems problems={problems.general} />

Once you're done with these, you should continue onto the rest of Bronze.

<Warning>

Some modules in the "General" section (ex. Fast Input & Output) are not relevant for USACO Bronze. You should skip these for now and return to these later.

<!-- However, make sure to check [Code Conventions](/general/code-con) for the templates that will be used for code snippets in later modules!
 -->

</Warning>
