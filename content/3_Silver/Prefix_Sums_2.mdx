## Max Subarray Sum

<FocusProblem problem={problems.maxsum} />

This problem has a solution known as [Kadane's Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem#Kadane's_algorithm). Please don't use that solution; try to solve it with prefix sums.

<Spoiler title="Why are the two methods equivalent?">

Consider the desired maximum subarray. As you go along from left to right, the prefix sum solution will mark the start of that subarray as the "current minimum prefix sum". Kadane's Algorithm, on the other hand, will set the current value to 0 at that point. As both solutions iterate through the array, they eventually find the right side of the maximum sum, and they find the answer to the problem at that location. In essence, Kadane's Algorithm stores the maximum sum of a subarray that ends at the current location (which is what the prefix sum solution calculates on each iteration), but it calculates this value greedily instead.

</Spoiler>

## 2D Prefix Sums

<FocusProblem problem={problems.sample2[0]} />

Now, what if we wanted to process $Q$ queries for the sum over a subrectangle of a 2D matrix with $N$ rows and $M$ columns? Let's assume both rows and columns are 1-indexed, and we use the following matrix as an example:

<center>

<table className="text-center">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>6</td>
			<td>11</td>
			<td>8</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>7</td>
			<td>11</td>
			<td>9</td>
			<td>4</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>6</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>3</td>
			<td>2</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>7</td>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>3</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

</center>

Naively, each sum query would then take $\mathcal{O}(NM)$ time, for a total of $\mathcal{O}(QNM)$. This is too slow.

Let's take the following example region, which we want to sum:

<center>

<table className="text-center">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>6</td>
			<td>11</td>
			<td>8</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td className="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-800">7</td>
			<td className="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-800">11</td>
			<td className="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-800">9</td>
			<td>4</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td className="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-800">6</td>
			<td className="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-800">1</td>
			<td className="bg-blue-100 dark:bg-blue-800">3</td>
			<td>2</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>7</td>
			<td>5</td>
			<td>4</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>3</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

</center>

Manually summing all the cells, we have a submatrix sum of $7+11+9+6+1+3 = 37$.

The first logical optimization would be to do one-dimensional prefix sums of each row. Then, we'd have the following row-prefix sum matrix. The desired subarray sum of each row in our desired region is simply the green cell minus the red cell in that respective row. We do this for each row to get $(28-1) + (14-4) = 37$.

<center>

<table className="text-center">
	<tbody>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>6</td>
			<td>12</td>
			<td>23</td>
			<td>31</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td className="bg-red-200 dark:bg-red-800">1</td>
			<td>8</td>
			<td>19</td>
			<td className="bg-green-200 dark:bg-green-800">28</td>
			<td>32</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td className="bg-red-200 dark:bg-red-800">4</td>
			<td>10</td>
			<td>11</td>
			<td className="bg-green-200 dark:bg-green-800">14</td>
			<td>16</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>7</td>
			<td>12</td>
			<td>16</td>
			<td>18</td>
			<td>21</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

</center>

Now, if we wanted to find a submatrix sum, we could break up the submatrix into a subarray for each row, and then add their sums, which would be calculated using the prefix sums method described earlier. Since the matrix has $N$ rows, the time complexity of this is $\mathcal{O}(QN)$. This might be fast enough for $Q=10^5$ and $N=10^3$, but we can do better.

In fact, we can do two-dimensional prefix sums. In our two dimensional prefix sum array, we have

$$
\texttt{prefix}[a][b]=\sum_{i=1}^{a} \sum_{j=1}^{b} \texttt{arr}[i][j].
$$

This can be calculated as follows for row index $1 \leq i \leq n$ and column index $1 \leq j \leq m$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\texttt{prefix}[i][j] =& \, \texttt{prefix}[i-1][j]+ \texttt{prefix}[i][j-1] \\
    &- \texttt{prefix}[i-1][j-1]+ \texttt{arr}[i][j]
\end{aligned}
$$

---

Let's calculate $\texttt{prefix}[2][3]$. Try playing with the interactive widget below by clicking the buttons to see which numbers are added in each step. Notice how we overcount a subrectangle, and how we fix this by subtracting $\texttt{prefix}[i-1][j-1]$.

<PrefixSumInteractive />

---

The submatrix sum between rows $a$ and $A$ and columns $b$ and $B$, can thus be expressed as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sum_{i=a}^{A} \sum_{j=b}^{B} \texttt{arr}[i][j]=&\,\texttt{prefix}[A][B]
        - \texttt{prefix}[a-1][B] \\
        &- \texttt{prefix}[A][b-1] + \texttt{prefix}[a-1][b-1]
\end{aligned}
$$

Summing the blue region from above using the 2D prefix sums method, we add the value of the green square, subtract the values of the red squares, and then add the value of the gray square. In this example, we have

$$
65-23-6+1 = 37,
$$

as expected.

			<td>6</td>

			<td className="bg-red-200 dark:bg-red-800">23</td>
			<td>31</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>2</td>
			<td>14</td>

			<td>51</td>
			<td>63</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td className="bg-red-200 dark:bg-red-800">6</td>

			<td>13</td>
			<td>36</td>

			<td>100</td>
		</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>

Since no matter the size of the submatrix we are summing, we only need to access four values of the 2D prefix sum array, this runs in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ per query after an $\mathcal{O}(NM)$ preprocessing.

### Solution - Forest Queries

<Warning>

We need to be cautious of off-by-one errors, as intervals can be inclusive, exclusive, 1-indexed, etc.

### 2-Dimensional

#### Point

We can apply a similar concept to 2D matrices. Let $\texttt{prefix}[i][j]$ be the sum of the values in the rectangle between $(0,0)$ and $(i, j)$, or $\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \texttt{arr}[i][j]$. $\texttt{prefix}[i][j]$ is equal to the sum of $\texttt{arr}[i][j]$ and all the values in the region formed by the union of rectangles $(0, 0), (i, j-1)$ and $(0, 0),(i-1, j)$.

To determine the sum of values in this region, we can add the sum of values in these rectangles ($\texttt{prefix}[i-1][j] + \texttt{prefix}[i][j-1]$) and subtract the double counted overlap $\texttt{prefix}[i-1][j-1]$. This can be expressed by

$$
\texttt{prefix}[i][j] = \texttt{arr}[i][j] + \texttt{prefix}[i-1][j] + \texttt{prefix}[i][j-1] - \texttt{prefix}[i-1][j-1]
$$

Given the sample case in [Forest Queries](https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1652), the algorithm goes as follows:

We first build array $\texttt{arr}$, which stores the locations of the trees, by incrementing every point by 1.

<center>
	<table className='text-center'>
		<tr>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>0</td>
			<td>0</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>1</td>
			<td>1</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
</center>

Then, we build the prefix sum array.

$$
\texttt{prefix}[i][j] = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} \texttt{arr}[i][j] = \texttt{arr}[i][j] + \texttt{prefix}[i-1][j] + \texttt{prefix}[i][j-1] - \texttt{prefix}[i-1][j-1]
$$

For our example, we get

<center>
	<table className='text-center'>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>0</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>1</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>1</td>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>4</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>2</td>
		<td>4</td>
		<td>5</td>
		<td>6</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>0</td>
		<td>3</td>
		<td>6</td>
		<td>8</td>
		<td>10</td>
	</tr>
	</table>
</center>

Notice it is padded with zeroes, and all queries can now be processed using

$$
\texttt{prefix}[A][B] - \texttt{prefix}[a-1][B] - \texttt{prefix}[A][b-1] + \texttt{prefix}[a-1][b-1]
$$

For example, if we query $(2, 2)$ to $(3, 4)$ we get $A=3, B=4, a=2, b=2$, and substituting into our equation, we get

$$
\texttt{prefix}[3][4] - \texttt{prefix}[1][4] - \texttt{prefix}[3][1] + \texttt{prefix}[1][1] = 6 - 1 - 2 + 0 = 3
$$ -->

<!-- #### Overlapping Rectangles

Given a rectangle with endpoints $(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2)$, we can compute the "layers" of many such rectangles bounded together through the use of increment and decrement points. Since our endpoints are not inclusive (note how area is the space in-between the points), our increment points are $(x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2)$, and decrement points are $(x_1, y_2), (x_2, y_1)$. Our prefix array construction remains the same as described in the previous section. -->

### Problems

<Problems problems={problems.cum2} />

## A More Complicated Example

What if we want to quickly answer the following type of query?

> Find $1\cdot a_l+2\cdot a_{l+1}+3\cdot a_{l+2}+\cdots+(r-l+1)\cdot a_{r}$.

In addition to taking prefix sums over $a_i$, we'll also need to take prefix sums over $i\cdot a_i$.

First, define the following:

$$
\texttt{ps}[i] = a_1+a_2+a_3+a_4+\cdots+a_i
$$

$$
\texttt{ips}[i] = 1\cdot a_1+2\cdot a_2+\cdots+i\cdot a_i
$$

Then, we have:

$$
l\cdot a_l + (l+1) \cdot a_{l+1} + \cdots + r \cdot a_r = \texttt{ips}[r]-\texttt{ips}[l-1]
$$

$$
(l-1) \cdot a_l + (l-1) \cdot a_{l+1} + \cdot + (l-1) \cdot a_r = (l-1)(\texttt{ps}[r]-\texttt{ps}[l-1])
$$

And so,

$$
1\cdot a_l + 2 \cdot a_{l+1} + \cdots + (r-l+1) \cdot a_r = \texttt{ips}[r]-\texttt{ips}[l-1]-(l-1)(\texttt{ps}[r]-\texttt{ps}[l-1])
$$

Which is what we were looking for!
